\begin{abstract}
The RSA cryptosystem has an established position as one of the most secure methods of secret sharing. However, it is also known to be a rather slow algorithm. As a result, the feasibility of its use on large amounts of data depends heavily on the components of the system it is run on. This work will analyze and discuss the efficiency of an RSA-CRT implementation on a range of computer systems. We will discuss the hardware and software components present on each system and compare several measures of the efficiency of execution. Given the increasingly critical nature of efficient and effective cybersecurity, the goal of this study is to contribute towards finding ideal conditions for the execution of this powerful cryptosystem.

% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by

% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:

% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter

\IEEEPARstart{A}{s} the scope of data stored in computer systems has expanded, so has the need for effective cybersecurity systems. The RSA cryptosystem, short for Rivest-Shamir-Adleman after its creators, has proven to be one of the most reliable systems available for secret sharing. Due to the notorious factoring problem, breaking RSA encryption is practically and computationally unfeasible using any currently known means. The system is not without faults, however, as the time it requires to operate is well known to be quite large. As a result, the size of messages that it can practically encode is quite small, reducing its use largely to sharing of keys used in other encryption schemes, or identity authentication.

RSA is utilized in several manners that are essential to common digital procedures. For secret sharing, the system can be used to ensure that confidential information, such as a key used for AES, cannot be discovered even if the secret is intercepted by a third party. In terms of average internet use, RSA allows for common users to be assured that the parties they interact with are who they claim to be. Even though the size of data such as these is quite small, these operations have to be performed extremely frequently, making the importance of efficient execution extremely high. As a result, research towards finding ideal running environments for the system is of considerable value.

The work performed for this study aims to discover environments and elements that are conducive to best-case efficiency of RSA. In section 2, we will discuss the basics of the RSA cryptosystem, followed by a description of the implementation used in section 3. Section 4 will give insight on what will be used to measure execution efficiency, and section 5 will provide comparison of the data that is found.

\section{The RSA Cryptosystem}
The RSA cryptosystem is a public-key cryptography system that facilitates secret sharing. It makes use of a public key, denoted by \textit{e}, a private key, denoted by \textit{d}, and a modulus value, denoted by \textit{n}. \textit{n} is determined with two distinct large prime numbers \textit{p} and \textit{q}. Depending on which of the two keys are used for encoding, either encryption/decryption or signing/authentication can be accomplished. Standard encryption and decryption is accomplished with two equations. A plaintext message \textit{m} that is encrypted to a ciphertext \textit{c} message with \textit{e} as shown in eqn. 1 can only be decrypted with \textit{d} as shown in eqn. 2.\newline

\textsuperscript{[1]}$c = m^e$ $mod$ $n$

\textsuperscript{[2]}$m = c^d$ $mod$ $n$
\newline

Signing and authentication can be accomplished via switching the keys used in the equation, as shown in eqn. 3 and eqn. 4 respectively.\newline

\textsuperscript{[3]}$c = m^d$ $mod$ $n$

\textsuperscript{[4]}$m = c^e$ $mod$ $n$
\newline

An alternative mechanism based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) can be used to increase efficiency both for decryption and, as it is analogous to the decryption process, for signing as well. Using this scheme, intermediate values determined using $p$ and $q$ in addition to the inverse of $q$ $mod$ $p$ are utilized. These values are determined as follows:\newline

\textsuperscript{[5]}$dP = (1/e)$ $mod$ $(p - 1)$

\textsuperscript{[6]}$dQ = (1/e)$ $mod$ $(q - 1)$

\textsuperscript{[7]}$qInv = (1/q)$ $mod$ $p$

These values can then be used to compute the output message without such costly operations as $mod n$. Using decryption as an example, this is accomplished as follows:\newline

\textsuperscript{[8]}$m_1 = c^dP$ $mod$ $p$

\textsuperscript{[9]}$m_2 = c^dQ$ $mod$ $q$

\textsuperscript{[10]}$h = qInv(m_1 - m_2)$ $mod$ $p$

\textsuperscript{[11]}$m = m_2 + (h)(q)$
\newline 

Signing with CRT can be accomplished in the same manner, simply swapping the positions of $m$ and $c$.

\section{Implementation}
The specific implementation of RSA was coded in C++11, making use of several classes. All RSA-specific operations are performed within the RSACipher class, which in turn makes use of two other classes. The SHAHash class performs any and all hashing operations, and can utilize various forms of SHA, including the commonly used SHA-224 and SHA-256. Lastly, the RandGen class generates random numbers for use in the creation of the primes $p$ and $q$, and the private and public keys.

Given that RSA makes use of prime numbers that are thousands of bits large, the 32- or 64-bit arithmetic currently utilized by many common systems is nowhere near large enough to accommodate the requirements of RSA. To handle this issue, the implementation makes use of the GNU Multiprecision arithmetic library (GMP), which allows for arithmetic operations on numbers of arbitrary bitlength. 

To the greatest extent possible (and necessary), the implementation is compliant with federal guidelines for RSA established across several Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) publications created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), primarily FIPS 186-4. A complete list of the relevant documentation followed can be found in the references section. The sole exception to compliance is in the RandGen class, which does not make use of a sufficiently strong external entropy/noise source. Given that the focus of this research is on efficiency rather than security, and the difficulty inherent in establishing such a source of randomness, this element was foregone in favor of research progress.

All interaction with the program is accomplished via a simple user interface, allowing for encryption, decryption with or without CRT, signing with or without CRT, authentication, and key generation. Although slight changes were necessary to ensure compatibility across various systems, the core of this interface remained largely the same across all data collection. Attempts were made at a implementation-independent GUI, but were eventually foregone in favor of research progress.

Although there are numerous further guidelines that establish padding schemes and other various additions to RSA such as those provided in PKCS \#1, the focus of this work is on the base cryptosystem, with no such additional systems added.
