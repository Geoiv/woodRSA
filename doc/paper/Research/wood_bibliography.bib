The digests are used to detect whether messages have been changed since the digests were generated. The Applicability Clause of this standard was revised to correspond with the release of FIPS 202, "SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions," which specifies the SHA-3 family of hash functions, as well as mechanisms for other cryptographic functions to be specified in the future. The revision to the Applicability Clause approves the use of hash functions specified in either FIPS 180-4 or FIPS 202 when a secure hash function is required for the protection of sensitive, unclassified information in Federal applications, including as a component within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols.",

  abstract =     "The Standard specifies a suite of algorithms that can be used to generate a digital signature. Digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation, since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time. This Standard specifies three techniques for the generation and verification of digital signatures: DSA, ECDSA and RSA. This revision increases the length of the keys allowed for DSA, provides additional requirements for the use of ECDSA and RSA, and includes requirements for obtaining assurances necessary for valid digital signatures.",
